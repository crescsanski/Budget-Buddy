LEVELING SYSTEM
-----------------------------
daily 50
weekly 250 (70% of total dailys)
monthly 750 (50% of toal dailys)

=2100 month =25200 year =252 per level

levels 1 - 100

1 year if doing all challenges

reason being we want this to be long term to help people budgetting
and maintaining habits. If done in a month then they would stop.
fixed rate because challenges always have same xp. No increase in
xp like video game rpgs. More like free to play daily and weekly
challenges.

Procedure that would be necessary for leveling
------------------------------------------------
add user_current_level_experience_threshold INT attribute to user
after challenge completion:
			 	1-add experience to user_experience
check if user_experience is greater than user_current_level_experience_threshold
if true and not max level: 	
				1-update user_current_level_experience_threshold.
				2-check challenges and items and add to corresponding inventories
				  where level_id equals new threshold.
else:				1-do nothing



CHALLENGES
---------------------
When a user updates any data for income, expense, sign-in....
	each action has a trigger (ON UPDATE INSERT ATTRIBUTE HERE)
Check challenge_inventory to see if user has any challenges with that trigger
(makes challenge type (ie: grocery expense, job income...) redundant)



SIGN-INS
---------------------
add last_signed_in TIMESTAMP to user table
add sign_ins INT to user table
if this week TIMESTAMP is greater than last_signed_in TIMESTAMP week
	set sign_ins to 1
else if today's TIMESTAMP day is greater than last_signed_in TIMESTAMP
	add 1 to sign_ins
check challenges_inventory for associated challenges 



NOTIFICATIONS
---------------------
possible to change user_has_notifications to INT instead of BOOLEAN
	then add notification_level to each notification
	(0 = no notifications, 1 = challenges only, 2 inspiratitional, 
	 3 = both,....ect)
As of now, the complexity behind this may be out of reach. Random inspirational
messages and persistent reminders may be a better fit for now.
